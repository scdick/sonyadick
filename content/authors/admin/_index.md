Sonya Dick is a professor of mechanical engineering at South Dakota Mines. Her research interests include ... She leads the SD-CFD lab, which focuses on the use of computational fluid dynamics applied to compressible flow phenomenea including shockwaves, high-energy-density materials, and hydrodynamic instabilities. Her research is relevant to planetary interiors, laboratory astrophysics, and inertial fusion energy, and general compressible flows.
